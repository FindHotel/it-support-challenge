# FindHotel IT Support Engineer Assessment

## Scenario

Imagine yourself working as part of the team that's responsible to onboard new employees.

Currently, the actions for this process is described below:
* A task is created in our board with the employee' username and the start date;
* We have to create the user, create a specific SSH-key, and attach the private key to the task card;
* Finally move the task to Completed.

However, the company is growing quickly and we have to automate this process.

## Task

On this interaction, you will be working to delivery at least these items:
* Decide which tool (Rundeck, Stackstorm, Ansible AWX, or any other) is possible to be used to execute these jobs/workflows;
* Install and setup the tool on the AWS account - You can have a [Free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/);
* A task card is created in our [Trello Dashboard](https://trello.com/b/kNlWX8Zn/supporteng) that we are going to invite you;
* Create a routine covering the scenario described above;
* Complete the task executing this routine.

Justify architectural choices and put in the backlog possible improvements for the next iteration.

For the documentation, any kind of script, or file that you judged relevant for the challenge, we suggest that you fork this repository, upload the files, and send to us.

### Assumptions

* This tool is going to be widely used, and we can expect new automations daily.
* Keep in mind possibilites to have automated remediation, incident response, etc.
* Could be good to have an option to run the routine manually, scheduled, or being trigger by any integration.
* Not only technical employees would be allowed to use the system, so a WebUI matters to execute any routine.

Try to deliver as much as you can in a reasonable amount of hours. Previous attempts took between 4 and 8 hours.

## Evaluation

Thus are the criteria that we will use to evaluate your work:
* Basic Operations skills with Cloud, O.S., software;
* Basic knowledge on how to interact with an API; 
* Organization and prioritization skills;
* Communication and writing skills.

Ask me if you need more information.
